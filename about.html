        <p class="about-title text-spacing">ABOUT</p>
        <p class="text-spacing">Teresa is passionate about crocheting.Her first contact with a yarn was as a child when she learned the craft from her grandmother. Many years later, she rediscovered her skills as a joyful hobby and as a productive business.</p>
        <p class="text-spacing"> She likes to experiment with different types of styles using a wide variety of hook sizes and types of yarn. Teresa also devotes much of her time to sharing her knowledge and passion for crochet.</p>
        <p class="text-spacing"> Teresa has two very naughty dogs and a loving husband who insists he doesn't care that their house has turned into a yarn warehouse. She currently lives in Toronto and studies computer programming (the reason behind this decision remains a mystery).</p>
